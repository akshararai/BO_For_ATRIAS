This repository is meant to run BO on ATRIAS models of varying fidelity using pre-generated feature transforms DoG. 
Some of the experiments are here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06047

The experiments for 9D and 50D controllers require feature transform data files that are too big to be added to the git repo.
Ask Akshara for access to these data files.
